## Tableau Visualization Projects üìä

Welcome to my Tableau portfolio! This repository showcases interactive dashboards and data visualizations that transform complex datasets into actionable business insights.

## üéØ About These Projects

These projects demonstrate my ability to design compelling visualizations, uncover data-driven insights, and create interactive dashboards that enable stakeholders to make informed decisions. Each project focuses on telling a story through data.

## üìÅ Projects

1. **Data Science Job Insights: Industry Trends and Analysis**

An in-depth analysis of global data science job market trends, examining salary distributions, job categories, and geographical patterns across the industry. This dashboard explores key questions like which countries offer the best opportunities, how salaries have evolved over time, and which job categories command the highest compensation.
Key Insights:

- Machine Learning and AI roles command the highest average salaries in the US
- Data Engineers lead in job availability with significant year-over-year growth
- Remote work compensation is increasingly competitive with in-person roles
- European markets show greater salary resilience during economic downturns

Dataset: Global data science job postings covering work years, salary data, experience levels, and employment types across multiple countries.
